While there's no single perfect solution to ensure universal `:focus-visible` support, we can mitigate the inconsistencies.  This example uses a JavaScript polyfill and adds specific focus styles for better cross-browser and assistive technology compatibility.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */

.focus-element:focus {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #007bff;
}

.focus-element:focus-visible {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px #007bff;
}

/*fallback styles for older browsers without :focus-visible*/
.focus-element:focus:not(:focus-visible){
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #007bff;
}
```

Include a JavaScript polyfill to enhance `:focus-visible` support in older browsers.

Note: Testing with different assistive technologies and browsers is crucial to ensure the focus styles are accessible and meet your design requirements.
